Simple Anchor Slider
============

Script created to facilitate setting slip their anchors just HTML. 

How?

See the example:

&lt;a href="#section-2" class="anchor-slide" data-speed="1000" data-retreat="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

After entering the class "anchor-slide" in your <a> you want to be the anchor tag, clicking on this element will be anchoring the element described in the "href" attribute (which is mandatory for the operation), may also have one configuration for each anchor with "speed-date" attributes and "data-retreat", it is not mandatory (you can edit the default setting very easy in the script).
